    <h1>Experiments in Music composition</h1>
    
    <p>Here is some music I've written while playing composer.  Its it all 
    synthesized, and was mixed and mastered using Audacity.  Not that some 
    of the music is not well written for the instruments its intended for; 
    this is especially true of the clarinet, which I used frequently but 
    knew nothing about how it was actually played.  Thus came I up with 
    music that sound good from a machine but would be very hard for a real 
    musician to actually play.  All music is copyright &copy; Jared Blackburn, 
    2006-2008.</p>

      <h3>The Mini-Symphony I</h3>
      <p>This is piece writen for small orchestra, and has two movements. 
      Early versions added two more movements, though these really added nothing new.
      and later "Attainment" was placed as the final movement of three, but this 
      also made no sense, as it was in a different style and for a larger and 
      more modern orchestra.  Early arrangements were longer through the use of 
      repeats to stretch it out. I let the first and second movement stand on their own 
      now.

    <h3>The Canons I</h3>
      <p>This contains two canonical sections, with different time intervals between then 
      lines of music, each of which could be a complete round on its own.  The the longer 
      of these is polyphonic and obvious, while the shorter is written to be heard as a 
      series of cords.  They have then been fit together so that the shorter sound like 
      a kind of bridge or chorous between versus.  Thus the name, this is not a canon, but 
      the merging of two.</p>

    <h3>Attainment</h3>
      <p>My "masterpiece," at least in so far as this was the highest level of mastery I 
      attained at music composition.  This is arranged for a full modern orchestra.</p>

      <h3>Fall</h3>
      <p>This is a slow, peaceful, mildly sad tune, alternately titled 
      "time alone" (the title was changed to mirror "Spring").
      It was written for violin, clarinet, and flute.</p>
