    <h4>Welcome to KnightFerret Software!</h4>
    
    <p>Greetings!  This page is a mix of learning project
    and shameless self promotion. Let me introduce myslef,
    I, the sole proprietor, have set this page up 
    as a showcase of my work in software development, 
    with the hope that the page itself can be exhibit 
    one.  I'm current a student in IT, but, though our 
    program doesn't actually teach software developmen, 
    I have been writing code for several years, since 
    childhood. I've taken it on myself to actively 
    expand this skill in terms of both languages and 
    types of software, and am actively seeking employment.</p>
    
    <p>I am open to freelance work, though how much I do 
    while a fulltime studnet I'm not sure of.  My ultimate 
    goal is to find a steady job as a programmer on staff
    as the beginning of a career in software develoment. 
    I have been working with Java for several years now 
    as well as a little C++.  More recently I have been 
    learning Python and C#, with JavaScript and Lua on 
    my "TODO" list (along with various frameworks and 
    APIs).  As this page shows I also know the basics 
    of HTML and CSS, though I don't consider those as 
    programming languages per se.</p>
