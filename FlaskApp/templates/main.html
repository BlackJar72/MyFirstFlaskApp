    <h4>Welcome to KnightFerret Software!</h4>
    <p>I, the sole proprietor, have set this page up 
    as a showcase of my work in software development, 
    with the hope that the page itself can be exhibit 
    one.</p>
    
    <p>I am open to freelance work, though my ultimate 
    goal is to find a steady job as a programmer on staff
    as the beginning of a career in software develoment. 
    I have been working with Java for several years now 
    as well as a little C++.  More recently I have been 
    learning Python and C#, with JavaScript and Lua on 
    my "TODO" list (along with various frameworks and 
    APIs).  As this page shows I also know the basics 
    of HTML and CSS, though I don't consider those as 
    programming languages per se.</p>
