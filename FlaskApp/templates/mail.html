		<center><h1>Not Implemented</h1>
		<p>Sorry, the mail form is not implemented.  Put simply, this demo page isn't 
		staying around so no one is likely to be contacting me.  Even more importantly 
		the code is going to be made public, so I don't want user names and passwords 
		in it (though this could be loaded from a separate file) or to sign up for 
		an e-mail just for this page.</p>
		
		<p>Please don't be disappointed.</p>
