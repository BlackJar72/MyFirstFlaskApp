	  There is nothing like a sunny day, <br />
	  Though I must also say, <br />
	  There is nothing like a stormy night, <br />
	  Something I greet with delight! <br />
	  For in the lightning I do see <br />
	  God's Eternal Mastery; <br />
	  In His fireworks I do find <br />
	  Beauty beyond the mortal kind. <br />
