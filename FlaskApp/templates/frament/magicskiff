	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2006</small>
	  
	  <p>Standing upon this lovely shore <br />
	  Like one from ancient tales of yore <br />
	  The mist swirls in a gentle breeze <br />
	  And I see outlined distant trees. </p> 

	  <p>Before me is a skiff so fine, <br />
	  Where some great king mine dine with wine, <br />
	  Where violet vales were hung from poles <br />
	  By some sweet but forgotten souls. </p> 

	  <p>I take your hand and climb aboard <br />
	  So this great lake we both may ford <br />
	  To an island of the most blessed <br />
	  Where I so long to be a guest. </p> 

	  <p>I set us both gently adrift <br />
	  And feel no reason to be swift. <br />
	  I like the journey long and slow <br />
	  We will enjoy it as we go. </p> 

	  <p>For as I drift with you out here <br />
	  I feel such peace and have no fear <br />
	  And feel feeling for you so dear <br />
	  And don’t care if the island’s near. </p> 

	  <p>Feeling such wondrous, holy awe <br />
	  As one absorbed in all he saw <br />
	  Here in this mystic world of myth <br />
	  And with the woman I am with. </p> 

	  <p>Then we reach that glorious shore – <br />
	  Like Avalon of ancient yore – <br />
	  Feeling the joy I can’t contain <br />
	  From kissing we just can’t refrain. </p> 

	  <p>But we’re only visitor here <br />
	  And soon we must go home my dear. <br />
	  But I’m so glad we don’t just stay – <br />
	  I’d rather journey here each day!</p>
