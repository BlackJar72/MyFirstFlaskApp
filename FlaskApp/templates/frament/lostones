	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2006</small>
	  
	  <p>Where on Earth did they all go? <br />
	  I fear that I’ll never know. <br />
	  I seems not all that long ago <br />
	  That I treasured them all so. </p>

	  <p>Are they on Earth at all? <br />
	  Is there a way I could call? <br />
	  Across my life is a wall <br />
	  Like they never were at all. </p>

	  <p>Was our time all but a dream? <br />
	  That’s the way it sure does seem. <br />
	  I long that I could redeem <br />
	  Those days that now seem a dream. </p>

	  <p>But the ones I loved I’ve lost <br />
	  For time has made that its cost – <br />
	  Or perhaps its I that tossed <br />
	  Away the ones that now are lost. </p>

	  <p>Could I bring them back today <br />
	  I’d not let them get away – <br />
	  But where to look I can’t say <br />
	  For they are all lost today! </p>
