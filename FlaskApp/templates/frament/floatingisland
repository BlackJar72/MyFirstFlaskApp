	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2005</small>
	  
	  <p>
	  Paradise floats on a sea <br />
	  Of turbulence that’s beneath me. <br />
	  The illusion’s so great and grand, <br />
	  But there’s no safety in this land. <br />
	  And so I’m tossed upon the waves – <br />
	  My island only briefly saves – <br />
	  For when the storms hit hard on me <br />
	  My island sinks into the sea. <br />
