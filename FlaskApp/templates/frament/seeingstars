	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2005</small>
	  
	  <p>The stars twinkling overhead <br />
	  Make me glad we’re not in bed, <br />
	  For out here it’s lovely <br />
	  And I’m glad you’re here with me. </p>

	  <p>The stars twinkling in your eyes <br />
	  Speak of love and tell no lies <br />
	  As I hold you in my arms <br />
	  And I’m dazzled by your charms. </p>

	  <p>I hold you here all the night – <br />
	  Nothing ever felt so right – <br />
	  Every night I see you here <br />
	  I come to hold you more dear. </P>

	  <p>There no place I’d rather be <br />
	  Than out here with you with me, <br />
	  Beneath the stars so very high <br />
	  And with the love in your eye. </p>
