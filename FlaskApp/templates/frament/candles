	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2006</small>
	  
	  <p>The candles burn, <br />
	  They light the room <br />
	  And for their term <br />
	  Dispel the gloom. </p>

	  <p>Their light’s so soft, <br />
	  With their warm glow <br />
	  Sitting aloft <br />
	  All things will show. </p>

	  <p>So calm they seem <br />
	  And give such cheer <br />
	  That in their gleam <br />
	  All things seem dear. </p>

	  <p>They burn their while <br />
	  And as they burn <br />
	  The make me smile <br />
	  And cease to yearn. </p>

	  <p>Then one by one <br />
	  They all go out <br />
	  ‘Til there are none <br />
	  And I’m without. </p>
