	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2006</small>
	  
	  <p>I hear them in the hall <br />
	  And from across the room <br />
	  Ringing out from the gloom <br />
	  Where no one stands at all. </p>

	  <p>The voices of the past <br />
	  Keep ringing in my head <br />
	  From the days now long dead <br />
	  And things that could not last. </p>

	  <p>Echoes from times long gone – <br />
	  From things I once held dear <br />
	  And people who aren’t here – <br />
	  Yet still they echo on. </p>

	  <p>So they ring through the years <br />
	  Bringing back all my tears <br />
	  And rekindling my fears <br />
	  Down the hall of the years. </p>
