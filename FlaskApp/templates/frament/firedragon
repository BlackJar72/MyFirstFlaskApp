	  O' great Dragon, <br />
	  Fly and Fight, <br />
	  With your fierce and  <br />
	  And fiery might. <br />
	  Find a town, <br />
	  High or low, <br />
	  And burn it down. <br />
	  Turn the timbers, <br />
	  Strong and fine, <br />
	  Into cinders, <br />
	  Hot and bright, <br />
	  In a flaming <br />
	  Funeral pyre <br />
	  Rising in <br />
	  A swirling spire. <br />
	  Go, fly, fight, <br />
	  For, one day, <br />
	  You'll meet your knight.  <br />
	  </p>
