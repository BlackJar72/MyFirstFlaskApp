	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2005</small>
	  
	  <p>As I walk beneath the trees <br />
	  And feel the cool summer breeze <br />
	  I’m so glad to be alive – <br />
	  Amazed at how I did survive. </p>

	  <p>Though the past was hard on me <br />
	  I look forward hopefully. <br />
	  The future I still can’t see – <br />
	  Hope it will be good to me. </p>

	  <p>No, the world was never kind, <br />
	  But now I find peace of mind. <br />
	  Life was surely not easy, <br />
	  But here and now I feel free. </p>
