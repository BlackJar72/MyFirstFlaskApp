	  <small>Jared Blackburn, 2006</small>
	  
	  <p>I met a man the other day <br />
	  Who seemed so strange I shied away. <br />
	  I didn’t know who he could be <br />
	  But saw him staring back at me. </p>

	  <p>So seeing him I had to know, <br />
	  Was he a forgotten friend or foe? <br />
	  I was afraid to ask his name – <br />
	  I’d never seen one quite the same. </p>

	  <p>But fin’lly  I walked up to him, <br />
	  Through the shadowing light so dim, <br />
	  And spoke to him and was surprised <br />
	  I never got any replies! </p>

	  <p>Then I stared back in disbelief, <br />
	  Filled both with fear and with relief – <br />
	  The image I saw was my own, <br />
	  I’d found a mirror, all alone! </p>
