    <h3>Skirfir's Mine: Dungeon Adventure Sandbox for BECMI, B/X, and OSE</h3>
    
    <p>Skirfir the Dwarf Lord was a great Dwarf, he led his people to a new home, dug a great mine and city within the mountain ... then everything fell apart, a plague, a famine, an orc invasion ... and Skifir and his clan were gone, and the location of his mine lost.  Lost, until you found a long, lost map to its location.</p>

    <p>Skirfir's mine in a low-level mini-campaign for 2-4 players and character's level 1-3.  Its a self-contained, indoor sandbox, from which many different stories may emerge.  It provides a small "megadungeon" to take player characters from level 1 to level 4, when they should be ready to explore the wider world.  As for that world, Skirfir's mine is not tied to any published setting, and has no canon location in any of them, and can easily be dropped into an existing world.</p>

    <p>This is adventure is design for use with BECMI, B/X, and compatible retroclones, design with a classic feel in mind.</p>
    
    
    <p>Skirfir's Mine is available as a free PDF, in print as a traditional book:</p>
