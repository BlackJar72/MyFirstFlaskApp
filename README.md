# My First FlaskApp

My first experiment into modern web development, focusing on the 
back-end in theory (though very little actual runnable code was used).  
The oiginal plan was for this to ultimately become a professional page 
to market my development skills, but lack of much to say turned into 
more of a personal web-page.  Perhaps later, with more time, I might 
add more content of some kind...?

This site contains music, poetry, and general text by myself.
