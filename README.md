# My First FlaskApp

My first experiment into modern web development, focusing on the back-end in 
theory (though very little actual runnable code was used). The oiginal plan 
was for this to ultimately become a professional page to market my development 
skills, but lack of much to say turned into more of a personal web-page. 
Perhaps later, with more time, I might add more content of some kind...?

This site contains music, poetry, and general text by myself.
